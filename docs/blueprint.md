# **App Name**: PackIt3D

## Core Features:

- Container Input: Accept user inputs for container dimensions (Length, Width, Height).
- Package Input: Accept user inputs for package dimensions (Length, Width, Height, Quantity).
- 3D Visualization: Display a real-time 3D view of the container and packed packages using Three.js or Babylon.js.
- View Controls: Allow users to rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D container view.
- Packing Logic: Apply a 3D bin packing algorithm to fit packages in the container.
- Results Summary: Generate and display a summary including the total container volume used (%), the number of packages fitted, and the remaining space.
- AI Optimization: Incorporate an AI-powered tool that allows the LLM to use reasoning to find better packing configurations, potentially utilizing heuristic optimization techniques.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL hue of 220 (blue) to convey precision and trust, saturation 0.7 and lightness 0.5, resulting in hex code #3380B8
- Background color: Use a very light tint of the primary hue (220), with saturation 0.2, and high lightness (0.95), resulting in the hex code #F0F5F7
- Accent color: Shift the hue approximately 30 degrees toward the left (190), adjust saturation and brightness for emphasis, such as 0.8 saturation and 0.6 brightness, resulting in the hex code #33A6B8.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, chosen for its modern, neutral, and readable qualities, making it suitable for both headings and body text within the application.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent dimensions, packing options, and export functions.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for input, visualization, and results.
- Incorporate subtle animations for user interactions, such as smooth transitions when rotating the 3D container or displaying packing results.
